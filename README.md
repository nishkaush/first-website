# first-website
First Website with HTML5 and CSS only


Main Challenges Faced and lessons learnt:


(1) Float and Positioning Elements (floated element moves left or right inside the parent whereas positioned elements can move either relative to their existing postion or relative to the position of their parent container anywhere on the body page.)

(2) Making the design responsive by using relationships between the elements

(3) Using Media Queries, although I only designed the website for min-width of 700px.

(4) Using meta viewport tag, just in case if anyone attempts to design the site for a mobile version.

(5) Using Linear Gradient to ensure that only the background of the element fades but not the text in the element.

(6) Putting icon inside the search bar and logo in the header (had to absolutely position them)

(7) Making my first triangle in CSS by manipulating its borders (used it in the teal colored section divider)

(8) Using floats to line up the images in the footer section and also to line up the three sections of the footer.
Using floats gives us less work to do since we only define the margins and let everything else take its own course.

(9) Using canva to design images, logos and icons since I am yet to learn Adobe Illustrator or Sketch 3.

(10) z-index is an incredible property to understand which element should stay on top. Usually floated elements take precedence over any non-floated elements unless they have z-index higher than 0.
